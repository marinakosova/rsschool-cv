            <h2 class="section-text-bold section-spacing">Summary:</h2>
            <p>I am a front-end developer with a focus on creating websites from JavaScript, CSS and HTML.</p>
            <p>I worked as a Fashion designer before I moved to the US. I was creating clothes for small businesses for several years. Thanks to this, I have a well-developed sense of color and shape, which is a great bonus in website development for sure!
                <p>I am really passionate about front -end development as well as self-development. I read a lot about self-development and self-discipline (from the books and programs of Tony Robbins) so I know how to motivate myself.</p>

            <h2 class="section-text-bold section-spacing">Code examples:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>My portfolio website.</li>
                <li>My last study task was to develop a small application using VueJS Framework. This project involves AXIOS, ROUTER, SCSS. I tried various scenarios, like login-protected pages and calling an API.</li>
                <li>I also have an example of fully Responsive Landing Page with responsive menu, hero image, responsive gallery, contact form, sliders. I have employed an advanced "flex" layout, so the website looks terrific in different browsers with different
                    screen resolutions.</li>
                <li>I have my own Bootstrap site, which I created for my personal project. A very simple page to drive additional traffic to my online store. This web site helps the customers to select the shape of the bow tie before they buy it.</li>
                <li>And this is another example of my Javascript code. This is a draggable notes app where I implemented saving data functionality using localStorage as well as drag nâ€™ drop only with Vanilla Javascript.</li>
            </ol>
