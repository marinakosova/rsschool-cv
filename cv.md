## Summary:
I am a self-taught web developer with a focus on creating websites from JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
I worked as a Fashion designer before I moved to the US. I was creating clothes for small businesses for several years. 
Thanks to this, I have a well-developed sense of color and shape, which is a great bonus in website development for sure!
I am really passionate about self-development and I read a lot about self-development and self-discipline (from the books and programs of Tony Robbins) so I know how to motivate myself.

## Skills:
* Responsive Design (HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Bootstrap);
* Javascript;
* VueJS (Vue Router);
* Other: axios, git.
* I use Visual Studio Code to create all my projects. I validate all my code using HTML/CSS validators, PageSpeed insights.

## Code examples:
1. [Portfolio website](https://purple-bush-0f4477c0f.azurestaticapps.net/).
1. My last study task was to develop a [small application using VueJS Framework](https://purple-bush-0f4477c0f.azurestaticapps.net/cats-dogs/). This project involves AXIOS, ROUTER, SCSS. I tried various scenarios, like login-protected pages and calling an API.
1. I also have an example of [fully Responsive Landing Page](https://purple-bush-0f4477c0f.azurestaticapps.net/responsive1/) with responsive menu, hero image, responsive gallery, contact form, sliders. I have employed an advanced "flex" layout, so the website looks terrific in different browsers with different screen resolutions.
1. I have [my own Bootstrap site](https://marinapatterns.com), which I created for my personal project. A very simple page to drive additional traffic to my online store. This web site helps the customers to select the shape of the bow tie before they buy it.
1. And this is another example of [my Javascript code](https://purple-bush-0f4477c0f.azurestaticapps.net/notes/). This is a draggable notes app where I implemented saving data functionality using localStorage as well as drag n’ drop only with Vanilla Javascript.

## Experience:
